# Introduction

The library provides a bump-in-the-wire (BitW) application that can intercept arbitrary TCP traffic,
wrap it in SSP21, and redirect to a different host and port. This functionality is almost identical to what
[stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/) provides for transport layer security (TLS).
